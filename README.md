# Project Recap
Social Buzz is a fast-growing technology unicorn that needs to adapt quickly to its global scale. Accenture has begun a 3 month POC focusing on these tasks:
**An audit of Social Buzz’s big data practice.**
**Recommendations for a successful IPO.**
**Analysis to find Social Buzz’s top 5 most popular categories of content.**
## Problem Occurring:
Over 100,000  posts per day  36,500,000 pieces of content per year!
But how to capitalize on it when there is so much?
## Uncover Insights
There are a total of 16 unique categories out of which animals and Science are the top one by score.
In content, there are 4 types- Photo, video, GIF, and Audio out of which most people prefer photo and video.
May month has the highest number of posts in terms of months.
